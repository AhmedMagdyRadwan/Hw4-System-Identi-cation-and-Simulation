Ev3 Line Following  Robot using  PID controller

Description of the project: 

  The project is to create a Lego Mindstorms EV3 line following robot that has the ability to follow any path using color sensor 
  (light sensor), the robot is controlled using PID program which is created on LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition software.
  and the PID paameters are tuned using different methodes like zeglar 
  
  
  
Description of the work process:

1) first i started by building the robot using the supplied manual book with the tools/parts box as a refrence.
    -The robot has two front wheels, each connected to a large motor.
    -One swivel wheel in the back.
    -one color sensor.
    -motors were connected to B and C  ports on the robot and color sensor to port 3.
    
 2) I used the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition software to create the code which i transfered it to the robot using  Bluetooth support which is included in the brick.
 
 3) after assembling the robot and connected it tomy laptop through bluetooth, first started to detect the max. and min. sensor reading for the light intensity reflected
